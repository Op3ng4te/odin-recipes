        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
            <br>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.<br>
                Add onion and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt; cook until softened, about 4 minutes.<br>
                Add Italian seasoning and 1 teaspoon garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 1 minute.<br>
                Add ground meat mix and 1 teaspoon of the salt; cook, stirring occasionally to crumble,<br>
                until well browned and cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Add marinara sauce and basil;<br>
                cook, stirring occasionally, until warmed through, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water,<br>
                 stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.<br>
                Add remaining 2 teaspoons garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. <br>
                Add heavy cream; cook, whisking often, until thickened and coats the back of a spoon, 8 to 10 minutes. <br>
                Remove from heat and gradually whisk in Parmesan cheese and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <br>
            <li>Transfer pasta and cream mixture to a greased 13x 9 baking dish; toss gently to combine. <br>
                Spread meat sauce evenly over pasta and sprinkle with mozzarella and crushed red pepper, if desired.</li>

            <li>Bake in preheated oven until bubbly and mozzarella is lightly browned, about 25 minutes. <br>
